# Eye Movement Exercise
The goal of this exercise was to create a pair of eyes whose pupils move to follow the mouse cursor. This project was created as an assingment for the MIT Full-Stack MERN Certification. For information on other projects I've created for the certification course, visit my [Github Portfolio Page](https://jasonrahm00.github.io/).
## Features
- A pair of simple eyes that are styled using CSS
- As the cursor moves around the screen, the eye pupils follow the cursor
### Original Features
- The starter code included only a single eye and no movement functionality
- A second eye was added (HTML code wad duplicated)
- JS Functionality was wired up to track they mouse cursor on page load 
### Additional Enhancements
- Default tracking behavior was removed from screen load
- A "Follow" button and function were added so eyes don't track until the button is clicked
- A "Stop Follow" button and function to remove the mouse tracker and reset the eyeballs to center
### Improvement Roadmap
- Update the stopFollow function to programmatically reset the functionality instead of just reloading the browser
- Add a button to add more eyes that also follow the cursor around
- Consider combining with Pacman exercise and create ghost with eyes that track pacman movement
## Implementation
- Clone, fork or download the repository
- Load the index.html into the browser or use a local server
